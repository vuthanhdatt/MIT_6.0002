## Problem set 3
### Answer for problem 6
![performance of the two robot types compare when cleaning 80% of a 20x20 room](https://github.com/vuthanhdatt/MIT_6.0002/blob/main/images/ps3/Figure_1.png "Performance of the two robot types compare when cleaning 80% of a 20x20 room")
The Standard Robot have a little bit faster than Faulty Robot, the difference decrease when number of Robot increase
![performance of the two robot types compare when two of each robot cleans 80% of rooms with dimension](https://github.com/vuthanhdatt/MIT_6.0002/blob/main/images/ps3/Figure_2.png "performance of the two robot types compare when two of each robot cleans 80% of rooms with dimension")
When the room aspect ratio increase(mean the room more arrow), the diferrences between two robot also increase.
